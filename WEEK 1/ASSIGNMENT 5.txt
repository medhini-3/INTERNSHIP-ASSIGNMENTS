ASSIGNMENT 5

	Brief introduction to Google Colab and its main features:

Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free cloud-based platform that allows users to write and execute Python code in Jupyter Notebooks. It is particularly useful for data science and machine learning projects.

Main Features:

Cloud-Based: No setup required, and code execution happens in the cloud.

Free GPU and TPU: Provides access to powerful hardware for training machine learning models.

Collaborative: Multiple users can work on the same notebook simultaneously.

Integration with Google Drive: Easy saving and sharing of notebooks.

Specific Use Cases:

Machine Learning Experiments: Training models using GPU/TPU.

Collaborative Projects: Sharing notebooks with team members for collaborative coding.

Prototyping and Experimentation: Quick setup for testing new ideas and algorithms.
